        <blockquote><p>Israel is a country in Western Asia. It is situated on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea, and shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest; it is also bordered by the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively. Tel Aviv is the economic and technological center of the country, while its seat of government is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is unrecognized internationally. Israel is a small country with a relatively diverse topography, consisting of a lengthy coastal plain, highlands in the north and central regions, and the Negev desert in the south. Running the length of the country from north to south along its eastern border is the northern terminus of the Great Rift Valley.</p></blockquote>

        <h1>Jerusalem</h1>
        <blockquote><p>Jerusalem is considered as the holiest land in the world and certainly one of the best places to visit in Israel. Jerusalem is a site of major significance for the three largest monotheistic religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity, and both Israel and Palestine have claimed Jerusalem as a capital city. Because of these strong, age-old associations, bloody conflicts to control the city and sites within it have been waged for thousands of years. Frequented by the religious folks from all over the world, it is glorified by ancient buildings and majestic structures.Popular tourist attractions in Jerusalem: The Western Wall, Mar Saba Monastery, Visit Yad Vashem, Temple Mount and Dome of Rocks, City of David and Hezekiah’s Tunnel, and St. George’s Monastery</p></blockquote>

        <h1>Bethlehem </h1>
        <blockquote><p>The birthplace of Jesus is certainly one of the best places to visit in Israel. Located to the south of Jerusalem in the West Bank, Bethlehem is almost 1.5-hour drive from the city center of Jerusalem. Plenty of churches and religious places are the prime attractions of the holy city.According to the Gospels (Matthew 2; Luke 2), Bethlehem was the site of the Nativity of Jesus Christ. Christian theology has linked this with the belief that his birth there fulfills the Old Testament prophecy of Israel’s future ruler coming from Bethlehem Ephrathah (Micah 5:2). Some modern New Testament scholars believe parts of the Gospel accounts to be later accretions and hold that Jesus was born in Nazareth, his childhood home, but normative Christian belief has sanctified Bethlehem as Jesus’ birthplace for almost two millennia.</p></blockquote>

        <h1>Dead Sea Region</h1>
        <blockquote><p>Located almost 400 m below the sea level in the heart of Israel, Dead Sea is nature’s true wonder and one of the famous places to visit in Israel. It’s sweeping landscapes and secluded charm enthrall every traveler planning a trip to Israel. The water body has the salt content of higher density, which makes humans float in the super saline water effortlessly. For nature lovers, there are places in and around the Dead Sea that make an ideal escape. It is one of the four saltiest bodies of water in the world. These special conditions are an outcome of its extreme geomorphological structure alongside a harsh desert climate. These create constant dramatic changes that form a landscape that is different from any other in the world. Also, the unique mineral content of the air, land, and water in the area is globally renowned for its therapeutic qualities, as is evident in that it has been a health resort for thousands of years. </p></blockquote>
